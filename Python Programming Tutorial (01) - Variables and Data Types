# A valid variable name is anything that does not start with a number and contains only letters and underscores (NO SPACES). 
# Capitals in variable names are allowed but do make a difference: the variable tim is NOT the same variable as Tim.

    #___________________________________________________________#
    
tim = "hello"
myVariable = True

myVariable = 3    # myVariable now is equal to 3
joe = myVariable  # joe is now equal to 3 because myVariable has the value 3 

    #___________________________________________________________#
    
var = "hello"
print("hi")
print(var)        # This will print "hello"

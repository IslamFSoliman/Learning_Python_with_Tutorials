# Iteration by Item
# Whenever we execute a loop we have gone through an iteration. We can "iterate" (or loop) through the elements within certain data types. We can loop through the following data types as they are a collection of elements.
# - Strings (a collection of characters)
# - Lists (a collection of elements)
# - Tuples (a collection of elements)

# To iterate through a collection means to look at all of the elements within the collection. We can do this using the syntax shown below.

myList = [1,4,6,"hi"]

for item in myList:
    print(item)

# This will print 
1
4
6
hi


# The variable "item" will be changed to equal the next item in the list after every loop (or iteration).

# Example
# An example of when we may iterate by item is if we are checking to see if a certain item exists in a list.

myList = [1,4,6,"hi"]

for item in myList:
    if item == 6:
        print("I found 6 in the list")
    else:
        print("This is not 6")

# eW can do the same with strings or with tuples.


# This program counts how many "l"s appear in the string 
myString = "hello tim"

count = 0
for item in myString:
    if item == "l":
        count += 1

print("I found", count, '"l"s in the string')

# When looping through a string we will look at each letter
# Looping through a tuple works the same as a looping through list

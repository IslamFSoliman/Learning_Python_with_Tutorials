# While loop
# very similar to a for loop.
# It simply continues to do something while a given condition is true.

while condition == True:
    print("I will run until the conditon is False")

# Breaking a Loop
# Sometimes while we are looping we may encounter a situation where we want to exit the loop.
# It may be the case that the condition keeping the loop running is still True 
# but we would still like to "break" the loop. We can do this using the "break" keyword.

while True:
    inp = input("Type a number: ")
    if inp == "5":
        break                # when 5 is typed we will stop asking the user to type a number
    print("Try again...")    # Try again will not be printed if 5 is typed

    #___________________________________________________________#
# Example

# When we want to keep asking the user for input until we get a certain value

run = False

while run:
    answer = input("What is 5 + 7")
    
    if answer == "12":
        print("Correct!")
        run = False
    else:
        print("Try Again...")

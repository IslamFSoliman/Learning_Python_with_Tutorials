Python as Calculator
2**3 = 8
2*2**3 = (2**3) will take priority to get calculated first then 8**2 = 16
5/5*3 = 3 Normal calculation takes place from left to right
'm' + 'o' Will act like Concatinate = 'mo'

Variables
x = 10 Informs the system that variable x equals 10
y = x*3 The system will retrieve x value and calculate y value = 30
y+5 = 20 Will give an error in assigning operator value since it goyes against the previous assigned value 30
Update
x = x+4 Inform the system to update x value to 14

Operators
z = 2**5 Request the system to calculate z value 32
y = 3+9/18 = 3.5 Devission takes priority in calculations
y = (3+9)/18 = 0.666666666 Parenthesis force the program to start with the sum operation
z = 12//5 = 2 Integerdivission (removes values < 1)
z = 19%7 = 5 Remander 19/7=2.something 19%7 removes the 2 and gives the remaining none devidable amount.

Variable Types
x = "CISCO"  #string '' could be used
type(x)  #functions as a piece of reusable code = name() resul as (string)
x1 = 40  #Integerdivission (int)
x2 = 50. #decimal (float)
G = True (bool)
Y - [1,4,6,8] (list)
